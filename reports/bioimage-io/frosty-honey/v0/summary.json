        "description": "The Omnipose (bact_phase) dataset is a large-scale collection of bacterial phase-contrast micrographs designed for training and benchmarking cell segmentation algorithms. It comprises 4,833 images capturing approximately 700,900 individual bacterial cells from 14 species, encompassing a wide diversity of cell morphologies and optical characteristics. \nManual cell annotation was performed using a streamlined labeling process, resulting in 47,000 accurately annotated cells that serve as the ground-truth segmentation dataset. These annotations were divided into a training set (27,500 cells) and a benchmarking set (19,500 cells), with comparable distributions of cellular metrics such as area, perimeter, and mean diameter, ensuring that the benchmarking subset faithfully represents the training data.",
